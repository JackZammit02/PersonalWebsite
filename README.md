Welcome to My Personal Website!

This website was created by me and is all about showcasing who I am and what I can do. Its main purpose is to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML to potential employers. However, I'm always eager to learn and improve, so any feedback you have is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring!
